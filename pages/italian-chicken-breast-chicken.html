            <p>This foolproof method for very tender and moist chicken breast filets is adapted from Joy of Cooking (the original method is called "Cockaigne") and originally was published, with a video, at The Kitchn. You really have to be patient and NOT lift the lid while the chicken is cooking to avoid it drying out. While it's cooking, make a sauce (pesto?) or vegetable side dish to enjoy with your perfectly delicious chicken!</p>

            <p>Chicken breast rice, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.<br/>

                    One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

                    Brines and marinades help tenderize the meat by bringing more moisture in the protein. With that extra moisture, you lose less when you cook. The simplest way to do this is with a dry brine — unwrap the chicken breasts, salt them on both sides and let them sit in the fridge for at least an hour.</p>

                    Italy has many variations of rice. The Neapolitan rice,
                    or Naples-style rice, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella 
                    (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte 
                    (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano 
                    (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) 
                    and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian rice resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, 
                    adding anchovies to olives and onions. the rice has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy,
                     the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.

                <p>Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness with the bottom of a wide jar or glass. You can also use the bottom of a small frying pan.Season the chicken breasts. Lightly season the chicken with salt and pepper.Heat a frying pan large enough to fit the chicken in a single layer over medium-high heat. When it is quite hot, add the olive oil. Swirl the pan so it is lightly covered with the olive oil.Reduce the heat to medium. Add the chicken breasts. Cook undisturbed for just about 1 minute to help them get a little golden on one side.Flip each chicken breast over.Reduce the heat to low.
                    Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Set a timer for 10 minutes, and walk away. Do not lift the lid; do not peek.After 10 minutes have elapsed, turn off the heat. (If you have an electric stove, remove the pan from the heat.) Reset the timer for 10 minutes and leave the chicken breasts in the pan. Again, do not lift the lid; do not peek.After the 10 minutes are up, uncover and your chicken is done. Make sure there is no pink in the middle of the chicken breasts. If you want to be absolutely sure it is cooked, you can use an instant-read thermometer to check — the chicken should be at least 165°F.

                    How to Season Chicken Breast With Easy Recipe Ideas ...
                    Marinating not only adds flavor, but the combination of healthy fat and acid in most recipes also helps tenderize the meat. A good marinade is roughly three parts oil to one part acid, plus salt and other seasonings like spices, crushed garlic, or a little natural sugar..Serve your chicken and rice with a side of steamed or roasted vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, or asparagus. These add color, texture, and nutritional value to your meal. Salad: A refreshing salad can provide a contrast to the warm chicken and rice.
                    Eating chicken and rice every day may provide a good source of protein and carbohydrates, but it is not recommended to have the same meal every day as it may lead to a lack of variety in your diet.
