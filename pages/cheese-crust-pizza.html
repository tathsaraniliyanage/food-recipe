                    Everything in a good bite of pizza should be balanced. The sauce shouldn't overpower the cheese and vice versa, the crust-to-sauce ratio should be even, and the choice of toppings should work fine together. It's not very often for someone to refuse a good slice of pizza, especially if it fits the general criteria.It's widely speculated that pizza came from the Greek word “pitta,” which means “pie” ; however some historians believe that pizza came from the Langobardic word “bizzo,” which means “bite.”Pizza is not only delicious but can also be a healthy meal choice when thought is put into its preparation. Though many frozen and fast-food varieties tend to be high in calories, fat, sodium and other unhealthy ingredients, pizza can be made healthier.</p>

                    And yet, from a health perspective, pizza is simply bad for your health, especially when consumed in great amounts. Eating pizza every day may sound like a fun idea, but in fact it's harmful. As Eat This, Not That! explains, one slice of pizza has 20 percent of the recommended daily amount of saturated fat.
                    Eating pizza can also be comforting, as it is often associated with a feeling of fullness and contentment. Pizza is also a great choice because it is customizable. Guests can choose their favorite toppings, allowing them to create their unique pizza.
                    It is one of the best foods not just for kids but also for adults. Children love pizza because it is delicious, easy to eat and because it helps them to bond with their family. It is a universal choice of pizza for parties, celebrations, and events. With all these reasons, it's no wonder why kids love pizza.

                In fact, a quarter of people (25%) love pizza so much, they said they'd serve pizza at their wedding. Pizza was also found to be the center of other celebrations and occasions, like Friday nights (64%), movie nights (64%), and graduations (57%).O
                After making your pizza, it needs to go into the oven right away. If you let it sit too long, the water in the tomato sauce will seep into the dough, resulting in a soggy crust.

                    <p>Pizza can be healthy if you make it the right way, but most take-out pizza and frozen pies have staggering amounts of sodium, fat, and calories, all of which can raise your risk of a heart attack.

                    Pizzas from supermarkets, restaurants and take-aways have a very high sodium content. Too much sodium destabilizes the balance between fluids and eletrolytes in your body, so it sends a message to your brain in the form of thirst.

                    <p>Cheese is fatty, meat toppings tend to be rich, and the sauce is sweet. Pizza toppings are also packed with a compound called glutamate, which can be found in the tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni and sausage. When glutamate hits our tongues, it tells our brains to get excited – and to crave more of it.</p>

                    One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

                    Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza,
                    or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella 
                    (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte 
                    (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano 
                    (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) 
                    and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, 
                    adding anchovies to olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy,
                     the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.
