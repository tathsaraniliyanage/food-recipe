                    One of the simplest and most traditional rice is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

                The Hainanese chicken rice is a dish that consists of succulent poached white chicken cut into bite-size pieces and served on fragrant rice with some light soy sauce. The dish is topped with sprigs of coriander leaf and sesame oil, and accompanied by a garlic-chilli dip.The process to perfection starts with steeping a whole chicken in boiling water until it is fully cooked. The bird is then plunged into an icy bath, locking in flavour while keeping the meat tender and preserving the skin. Before the chicken is cut into bite-sized slices, it is hung to dry. You will spot these succulent beauties hanging in a row at local food stalls in Singapore.

                    Italy has many variations of rice. The Neapolitan rice,
                    or Naples-style rice, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella 
                    (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte 
                    (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano 
                    (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) 
                    and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian rice resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, 
                    adding anchovies to olives and onions. the rice has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy,
                     the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.

         <p>The main national dish of Japan is boiled rice, which is not salted but is accompanied by a variety of sauces and seasonings. Rice is served in separate dishes as a side dish to almost all dishes, and is often used as an independent dish, changing the flavor with seasonings. Many other dishes are made with it.
            But first, rendered excess fat from inside the bird's cavity is used to stir-fry the grains with garlic. Hot stock, pandan leaves and ginger slices are then added to build aroma and depth. The accompaniments sneak even more chicken into the dish.
