                <p>fig cheese bread, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.
                    Sweet fresh figs pair naturally with almond, but if fresh figs are scarce, topping with other fresh, in-season fruit like peaches or strawberries will work well too.
                    Aside from being eaten as a tasty snack, dried figs can be incorporated in stews and taste great with hearty meats such as duck and lamb. They can easily be incorporated into a salad, like this simple Fig & Goat Cheese Salad. They taste especially great with a balsamic vinaigrette.

                    One of the simplest and most traditional breads is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

                    Italy has many variations of fig cheese bread. The Neapolitan fig cheese bread,
                    or Naples-style bread, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella 
                    (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte 
                    (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano 
                    (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman fig cheese bread often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) 
                    and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian fig cheese bread resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, 
                    adding anchovies to olives and onions. fig cheese bread has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy,
                     the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.
