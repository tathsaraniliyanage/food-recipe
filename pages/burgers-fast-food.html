                    One of the simplest and most traditional burger is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.

                    Italy has many variations of burger. The Neapolitan burger,
                    or Naples-style burger, is made specifically with buffalo mozzarella 
                    (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte 
                    (mozzarella produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano 
                    (a variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman burger often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) 
                    and uses onions and olives. The Ligurian burger resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, 
                    adding anchovies to olives and onions. burger has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy,
                     the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.

                    What Happens if You Eat a Burger Every Day - Parade
                    While it's true that burgers are high in protein, they aren't exactly a healthy food. “Burgers are high in saturated fat, which can lead to heart disease and high cholesterol levels,” says Long Island-based registered dietitian Kimberly Wiemann, MS, RDN. This is the main reason why burgers are considered unhealthy

                <p>Pop your burgers on the barbecue or in a hot, non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Cook for 5-6 mins on each side for medium and 8-9 mins on each side for well done.</p>

                    If you are trying to lose weight or improve your health, you may want to limit your burger intake to once every two weeks or so. And if you have a specific medical condition that requires you to watch your fat or cholesterol intake, you'll need to be even more careful about how often you eat burgers.</p>
